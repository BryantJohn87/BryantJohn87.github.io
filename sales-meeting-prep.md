# Sales Meeting Preparation
## Questions to prepare for before a Sales or Project Kickoff Meeting
The following are some good questions for each team member to think about before heading into a sales meeting or a project initiation meeting.

1. Tell us about yourself/your background
2. What do you find interesting about working on this project?
3. Why is Ruby (or other technology) the best platform to use for this project?
4. What are some of the past projects you have worked on (related to industry, brand new/existing)?
5. What are some of the factors we find short over what we consider an MVP? (shows weâ€™re thinking deeply about the project)
