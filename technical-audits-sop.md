# Technical Audits

A technical audit may be performed with prospective and/or existing clients. The technical audit team typically consists of the sales team and one developer. In some cases, we may include representation from our product management team.

## Prospective Clients

A technical audit is partially a sales process and partially a project kickoff process. It serves the following purposes:

1. Help Def Method better understand client needs/requirements
2. Help clients learn more about Def Method software engineering processes
3. Review the current system architecture and application codebase (If Applicable)
4. Allow Def Method to meet with clients and showcase our ability to collaborate as a team
5. Provide opportunities for Def Method to make engineering process and technical recommendations
6. Help Def Method evaluate if the client is a good fit for us (business and cultural perspective)

## Existing Clients

A technical audit is meant to evaluate the system architecture and review the application codebase. It serves the following purposes:

1. Review the current software development process
2. Provide opportunities to make architectural enhancements
3. Help improve the overall quality of the code and/or tests

## Step 1: Create Pivotal Tracker Story

The developer creates a new Pivotal Tracker story in [Do Hack While True](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2123629)

## Step 2: Create Technical Audit Document/s

The sales team creates a new internal technical audit document to capture and store important information regarding the audit and the actual audit results. The technical audit document is a living document that can be viewed and updated by the technical audit team members.

The sales team enters high-level information they have available about the client/company, Def Method goals, client expectations, budget, timeline, etc. Once that is done, they invite the assigned developer to collaboratively review/update the document as necessary.

## Step 3: Review Clients, Goals and Products

The developer begins to review the technical audit goals and research the client/company. If applicable, it helps to learn and/or research new languages and technologies ahead of time. As part of this effort, the developer starts to update the living technical audit document created by the sales team. Developers may request the sales team for additional information or clarification on an item.

The developer reviews and completes technical document sections 1 through 3.

## Step 4: Initial Client Discussion

The sales team organizes a meeting with the client team. The assigned developer prints prepared notes from all previous steps, then meets with the client for technical discussions. At this meeting, the developer takes notes related to the client team, languages and/or technonlogies and application details.

Note:
* Remote Discussions: Reserve conference room. Check audio/video ahead of time.
* Client Office: Check with Julia and/or Joe re: client dress-code ahead of time.
* Def Method office: Make them feel welcome. Arrange beverages and/or snacks for everyone. Feel free to give Def Method marketing materials, e.g. pens, post-cards, etc.

### Sample Questions

The developer should try to speak 20% of the time and listen 80% of the time. The below leading questions will hopefully get the client talking about their product, team and process.

**MVP Projects**
* Tell me about the company you are looking to build?
* In your mind what does the product look like?
* How will you be using technology?
* What would you say is the most important feature of the product?
* What will some of the biggest risks be?
* Do you have a date in mind for when you would want to launch the MVP by?
* Who else is on your founding team?
* Do you have any thoughts on the languages/frameworks you would want to use to build the product?
* What are the target devices for this application? (Examples: Desktops, iOS Mobiles, Android Mobiles, Tablets, etc.)

**Existing Teams**
* What project is your team currently working on?
* What languages/frameworks do you use?
* What are your goals for the next few months? For this year?
* What are some process challenges youâ€™ve experienced?
* What does the current team structure look like?
* How are tests currently written?
* What process to you use to manage product development?
* How are stories written?

### Identify Client Software Engineering Team

Discuss/Review team members and their roles/responsibilities.

## Step 5: Review Application and/or Create Feature Estimates

### System Architecture

Discuss/review client application database, backend application, frontend application, application age/state and future roadmap/vision. If applicable, the developer should request the client to provide a demonstration of their current application. This is an opportunity to take a deeper dive into the requirements, system architecture, database/s and backend/frontend applications. The developer should ask questions about the client software development process. They should also discuss client pain points and application bottle-necks.

### Code Review

If the technical audit includes a code review, the developer should evaluate the projects/repositories using these [guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kqEs9_mC464uFyfccfkSyfdvfv30ZeheURw0JvbIBG0/edit).

### Feature Estimates

If the technical audit includes feature estimates, the developer should work with the sales team to complete a project estimate spreadsheet using this [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19JVvNR975nJiqC7ioOHGBoG1RfaUvO-LXzAwgiAUVGI/edit#gid=0).

### Audit Results

The developer reviews collected/discussed information for the above steps, then organizes relevant notes from the discussions and provides recommendations to meet client and Def Method goal/s. It is important to include any **red flags** that were observed during any phase of the technical audit process. Developers are encouraged to review their findings with other Def Method team members. The developer reviews and completes the technical audit document sections 1 through 7.

## Final Client Discussion

The sales team organizes a meeting with the client team. The assigned developer presents audit results to the client team.

Start off by thanking the client for all the information and support they provided us via meetings, emails and/or mockups/wireframes. This shows we researched their requirements with due diligence. Explain the Def Method approach to building the client application. Talk about breaking down the requirements into workflows and user stories. This helps demonstrate our organized approach and well-thought-out plan.

### Code Review

We recommend the following approach to this discussion:

Open the technical audit document and refer to the code review results. Start with a high-level view of the application. Then talk about the development and test environments, code complexity, automated tests, etc. Praise the nicely-written code and/or tests. Next, mention the important "red flags" discovered during the review. Stay positive in your presentation. Instead of saying "there are no automated tests", consider saying "we need to add automated tests". This shows we want to work *with* them to build and/or enhance this application. Emphasize our expertise with a given language/technology, e.g. ReactJS, Rails, automated tests, etc. to help reassure them they're in good hands with us.

### Feature Estimates

We recommend the following approach to this discussion:

Open the feature estimates spreadsheet and share your screen with everyone. Start with the "Legend" sheet and explain our nomenclature for estimates. Next, open the "Features Estimates" sheet and discuss each workflow and its associated stories. Whenever possible, ask the client questions to keep them engaged in the discussion. For example: "We believe a Rails backend and a ReactJS frontend works well for your needs. What do you think?" This is also a great time to ask them questions for any open issue/s. This open dialog shows we want to work *with* the client team and helps build our relationship with them. Then open the "Feature Priorities" sheet and explain the separation of workflows/features into backlog and icebox items. Show them how easy it is to navigate between sheets/tabs and adjust/move feature priorities.

After the meeting, share the feature estimates with the client team and send them a "Thank You" note.
